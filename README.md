# Introduction
Hi! I'm [He-Lihong], a student in the Software Maintenance 
and Evolution course. 
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance 
practices and how to work with legacy systems.
- **Fun fact**: I love playing the guitar in my free time.
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in 
maintaining and evolving software.
